# Agile Prototyping Reflection
<details>
  <summary><strong>Group reflection</strong></summary>

  As a group, we focused on incorporating the developmental stages of building knowledge into the structure of our board game. By creating cards that represent different building systems in their inital stage, middle stage, and final stage, we ensured that players gradually encounter and engage with the growth of a building. Each card presents a focused question or scenario that helps players understand the function and relevance of a specific system. This setup mirrors the developmental process of learning, where foundational knowledge is built upon step-by-step as players progress in the game.  


  One of the biggest advantages of our idea is how it transforms learning into an engaging, interactive experience. The use of a board game format, combined with dice rolls and movement, makes the learning process dynamic and enjoyable, appealing to a variety of learners. Additionally, the game encourages knowledge retention through repetition and gamified challenges. Players encounter questions that not only test their understanding but also reinforce key concepts over time. The variety of systems covered, ensures a holistic approach, helping participants see the interconnectedness of different building systems.

The game also promotes healthy competition, motivating players to improve their understanding of architectural systems in a fun and low-pressure environment.


Through reflection, we recognized a few limitations in our board game:

- **Depth of Content:** While we aimed to cover a broad range of building systems, we acknowledge that the questions on the cards may not delve deeply enough into certain topics, which could limit the learning experience for advanced players.
- **Replayability:** With a fixed set of cards, the game might become repetitive after a few rounds, reducing its long-term engagement value.
- **Time Constraints:** The game may require a significant time investment, which could make it less appealing for players with tight schedules.
Inclusivity of Difficulty Levels: We realized that the questions might not be equally accessible to players with varying levels of knowledge, potentially alienating beginners or boring experts.

During the Agile Prototyping course, I have learned to have a new approach to design, enabling me to be more creative and think in a more open and abstract way. I gained a deep understanding of how systems and their processes can inspire innovative design solutions for architecture and building systems. This methodology allows for a dynamic and adaptable approach, particularly when designing in uncertain or complex environments. The concept of applying biological insights like growth stages, genetic structures, and system evolution to buildings was an intriguing way to approach the architectural engineering discipline.
The reverse engineering approach we used, particularly with my work on the structure system, also played a big role in expanding my mindset. By starting with the end in mind and breaking down completed designs to understand their essential parts and how they evolved, I was able to approach problems more abstractly. This process helped me to look at buildings as systems that grow in response to various external factors, which in turn gave me a broader perspective on how to design structures that can adapt to changes over time.

Through this course, I’ve developed a deeper understanding of how biomimetic design and agile processes can push the boundaries of architecture, making it not just a field focused on solving today's problems, but one capable of anticipating and responding to the challenges of tomorrow.

#### How I might apply this in the future
In the future, I plan to apply the Agile Prototyping methodology to create flexible and innovative designs. For example, I can use growth stages to design structural systems that adapt to environmental conditions, such as varying wind loads or seismic activity, by incorporating materials or configurations that respond dynamically to these forces. Biomimetic principles can inspire sustainable solutions, such as lightweight yet strong frameworks modeled on natural structures like bones or shells.
This approach will be particularly valuable for addressing challenges like climate change or designing in uncertain environments. Additionally, the reverse engineering mindset will help me collaborate effectively across disciplines, ensuring that different building systems work together to create adaptable and future-ready solutions.

#### Further challenges that the Agile Prototyping Methodology raises that need to be solved
While the Agile Prototyping methodology offers great potential, there are several challenges that still need to be addressed. One major challenge is how to balance adaptability with long-term stability. Agile systems encourage continuous iteration and change, but in architecture and construction, there are often constraints like building codes, budgets, and structural integrity that may limit how flexible these designs can be in the long term.
Another challenge is scaling the approach. While Agile Prototyping works well for smaller-scale projects or conceptual designs, applying it to large, complex buildings or urban planning presents difficulties in coordinating the rapid iteration of multiple systems at once, especially when these systems must integrate seamlessly.

Addressing these challenges will help refine and optimize the Agile Prototyping methodology, making it more practical and effective for the future of the built environment.

#### Further Challenges in the Common Building Growth Stages
The concept of Common Building Growth Stages introduces its own challenges, particularly in defining clear, functional stages that apply universally to different types of buildings and systems. Aligning these stages across multiple disciplines, such as structural, mechanical, and environmental systems, can create complexity in ensuring they integrate seamlessly. Additionally, the sequential nature of growth stages might not align well with projects requiring non-linear or overlapping workflows.


#### Advantages of the Common Building Growth Stages
The Common Building Growth Stages provide a structured framework for designing adaptable systems. By breaking a design into defined stages, it becomes easier to identify key components and how they evolve over time. This method facilitates collaboration across disciplines, as it establishes a common language and process for integrating various systems. Additionally, it encourages forward-thinking design by emphasizing how a building can adapt and grow in response to future demands or external pressures.

#### Limitations/Challenges in Applying the Projects to Advanced Building Design 2025
Applying these projects to Advanced Building Design 2025 may face several limitations. For example, the iterative and experimental nature of Agile Prototyping might conflict with the tighter time constraints and deliverable-focused expectations of the course. Integrating Agile Prototyping into the course may require balancing its innovative potential with practical application and measurable results to align with course goals.

  #### What have you learned in the course?
I have learned how Agile Prototyping focuses on teamwork, flexibility, and working step by step to improve designs. The course showed me how to use Agile principles in architecture, like creating adaptable building systems that can change based on the project’s needs. I also learned how important communication and collaboration are, especially by working closely with teammates and clients. Another key lesson was reverse engineering, where we study existing buildings to figure out their systems and features so we can improve them or create something new.

#### How might you apply this in the future?
I can use Agile Prototyping in future projects, especially when working with teams from different fields like engineering, design, and construction. It will help me make flexible designs that adjust to changes and involve clients early to get their feedback. I could also use it to create new systems for sustainability and architecture. The reverse engineering skills will help me analyze existing designs to find what works best and use those ideas in new projects.

#### Further challenges raised by the Agile Prototyping Methodology
One big challenge is getting different experts, like architects and engineers, to work together smoothly since they may have different ways of working. Breaking down existing building systems into simple parts while still keeping important details can also be tricky. For bigger projects, it might be hard to keep things flexible while managing complexity. Lastly, managing time is important to avoid overloading the team and to keep everyone motivated.
Further challenges in Common Building Growth Stages
It is not easy to create a set of growth stages that work for all types of buildings because every project is unique. Translating ideas from nature, like how things grow, into building design can be complicated. Each stage needs to be tested to make sure it fits the building’s purpose and can adapt if needed, which takes time and effort. Also, spreading resources across the stages without running out or overloading any one stage is a big challenge.

#### Advantages of the Common Building Growth Stages
These stages give a clear plan to follow, making it easier to handle complicated projects. They also help bring different fields, like architecture and engineering, together into one process. The stages are flexible enough to adapt to changes or new needs, which is useful for future projects. They also help teams learn and improve because each stage provides new insights that can be used in later projects.

#### Limitations/challenges in applying the projects to Advanced Building Design 2025
The project only provides a limited understanding of the principle of Agile Prototyping Methodology. It would be time consuming to understand the common growth stages of the building and adapt it to advanced structures. Instead of using the very limited time frame to create the building, incl designing, calculating and projecting, the time would instead be used to understand the common Methodology.
By solving these challenges and using the benefits of Agile Prototyping, we can make innovative and flexible designs that are useful in real-world architectural projects.

  #### What you have learnt in the course?
This course has been very giving in terms of understanding the process of developing, growing and making building a reality. The course has shown in an abstract manner how challenging it can be to incorporate several disciplines, because of different viewpoints, perspectives and interpretations.

#### How you might apply this in the future?
Knowing the difficulty in incorporating different disciplines it will be an advantage to be aware and perhaps solve the challenge in advance by understanding the viewpoint of the other disciplines and assess the clashes that could occur in advance.

#### Further challenges that the Agile Prototyping Methodology raises that need to be solved?
Improving the corporation of several disciplines and understanding the challenges of each, to develop solutions in advance and to avoid clashes and delays due to unforeseen misunderstandings later on in the critical part of the project.

#### Further challenges in the Common Building Growth Stages ?
The common building growth stage may not be so common, and that could raise the challenge of some systems having a different plan or perspective on how to grow a building that could interrupt the development of another system.

#### Advantages of the Common Building Growth Stages?
The advantages of common building growth stages are that there is a universal understanding of the stages and process of growing a building or a project, through all the systems. This basic understanding and commonality will create a more homogeneous and effective process.

#### What limitations/challenges that are in applying the projects to the course Advanced Building Design 2025?
The challenges will possibly be the communication and understanding the different aspects of other systems work method and the interference it has with other systems. A challenge will also be, if wanting to understand more the challenges of all the systems, it would also be time consuming, which results in perhaps being behind on the time schedule, and then the question arises if it is worth it and if the time spent can be retrieved through the more common and fruitful methodology?
